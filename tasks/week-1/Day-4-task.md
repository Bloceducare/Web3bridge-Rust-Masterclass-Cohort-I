# Task 1: Structs - Library Item Management

## üìù Task Description

You are building a basic library system to manage different types of items in a collection.

## üí°Requirements

- Create a `struct` named `LibraryItem`.
- It should contain three fields:
  - `quantity: i32`
  - `id: i32`
- Add a third field called `item_type`, which should be of an `enum` type named `ItemType`.
- The `ItemType` enum should have at least two variants (e.g., `Book`, `Magazine`,`Fiction`).

- Implement two functions:
  - `display_quantity(item: &LibraryItem)` ‚Äî prints the quantity
  - `display_id(item: &LibraryItem)` ‚Äî prints the ID
  - another fn to display the type of the LibraryItem.
