There are two main categories of data types in rust language: scalar types and compound types
scalar types represent a single value. Viz;
Integer â€“ Whole numbers. Can be signed (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize) or unsigned (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize).

Floating-point numbers â€“ Decimal numbers. Two types: f32 (32-bit), f64 (64-bit)

Boolean â€“ Represents true or false.

Character â€“ A single Unicode character. Use single quotes: 'a', '9', 'ðŸ˜Š'.
